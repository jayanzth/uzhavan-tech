# uzhavan-tech
I developed a website for a green tech startup run by my department faculty, that sports a minimalistic yet intuitive look and focuses on their mission to make use of Hydroponics and yield better results for farmers at affordable rates.

#This was developed during my tenure as a Web Development Intern at Oasis Infobyte.
